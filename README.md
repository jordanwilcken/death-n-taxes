# Death-n-Taxes
It's my very first Elm application. Runs a simple statistical analysis on user-supplied tax information.

## How to Run
Elm compiles to javascript, and I've included the compiled javascript in this repository. Just open index2.html in your favorite browser, and you're off!

## Why'd I build this Thing?
I find Elm quite fun, and I like Elm's creator quite a bit. Don't know why I chose the tax theme, but financial software is common stuff, I think. If you are at all curious about Elm I highly recommend installing it and reading through [this pleasant little guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).
